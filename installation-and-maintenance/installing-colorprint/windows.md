# ðŸ–¥ Windows

Before performing the installation, your Windows system must meet the following requirements:

| System     | Framework                                                    | Terminal                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 7+ | [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) | [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) or Windows 10 cmd.exe |

We advice you to use the terminal emulation software capable of displaying the VT sequences on systems older than Windows 10.
